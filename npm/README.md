Shaper is a minimal data platform built on top of DuckDB and NATS to build and embed analytics dashboards into your software.

This NPM package makes it easy to install and run Shaper locally for development purposes.

You can run Shaper directly via npx:
```bash
npx @taleshape/shaper
```

Or you can install it globally:
```bash
npm install -g @taleshape/shaper
```

Then run it:
```bash
shaper
```

To run Shaper in production, we recommend using Docker.
